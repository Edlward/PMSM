/**
 * @file	BasicMotorControl.c
 * @author 	Pavlo Manovi
 * @date	March 21st, 2014
 * @brief 	This library provides implementation of control methods for the DRV8301.
 *
 * This library provides implementation of a 3rd order LQG controller for a PMSM motor with
 * block commutation provided by hall effect sensors and a Change Notification interrupt system.
 * This LQG controller has the estimator and all other values exposed for experimentation.
 *
 * As of Sept. 2014 this method is included only as a method of integrating BLDC motors easily 
 * with the PMSMx module.  For use with the SUPER-Ball Bot and the geared Maxon Motors, please
 * use PMSM.c for motor control with the #SINE definition.
 * 
 * Note: To use this method of motor control CN must be set up.
